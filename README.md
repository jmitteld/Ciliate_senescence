# Ciliate_senescence
This is a repository for source code and computer output from two numerical models exploring the way that cellular senescence first evolved in ciliates. Ciliates are typically able to clone themselves a few hundred times before they suffer cell senescence and die. The only way to reset their "aging clock" to zero is to share genes, via conjugating with another of the same species. Thus, cell senescence evolved to enforce the sharing of genes, which otherwise would be unfavored by individual selection.
